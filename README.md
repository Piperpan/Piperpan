## About me
### This is my first try on GitHub and I'm just trying to learn about it.


**Piperpan/Piperpan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on solar PV industry
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about IA and data analysis
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am also a 3D printing and drone building enthusiast.
